# From The Depths (Working title)

###### Summary
    A sea worm is born into a beautiful habitat at the bottom of the ocean, 
    but witnesses its destruction after radioactive waste descends down from 
    the ocean surface. When there is no life left, the sea worm begins travelling 
    upwards in desperate need of food. It begins it's journey as a small worm, 
    but grows in size as it travels further upwards. The radioactive waste 
    has given the worm special abilities, it is able to absorb the properties 
    of the organisms it eats. E.g. it will grow a light if it eats an angler fish. 
    The game ends with the sea worm reaching the ocean surface and killing
    the ocean polluters in the boats above.

    Might scrap most of this since it makes more sense in terms of progression to be
    travelling downwards towards the more dangerous and interesting areas.

###### Thoughts
    Don't know if it should be able to have multiple properties at the same time. 
    Maybe some could be compatible, but others override each other? Maybe it could 
    switch between obtained properties, but that is not very interesting and some 
    abilities might lose their usage further up the ocean.

    I want to focus on immersiveness and that everything somewhat "makes sense". 
    For example if the player dies, the sea worm can't just respawn from thin air. 
    Maybe it is left unconscious and it wakes up after descending down to the previous checkpoint.

#### Mechanics
    Swimming:
        Player swims in strokes. There is a very small or no cooldown on the strokes because the game should feel responsive,
        but the player will gain extra momentum by timing the strokes. This is done by performing a new stroke 
        right after the previous stroke is finished, and this will allow the player to gain a lot more speed.
        A misstimed stroke will not kill all the momentum, but it will be reduced.
